 F. Webscraping of Listing & Property Data Is Not Allowed Crawling the Redfin.com and network sites is allowed for inclusion in web search engine results only. Webscraping, downloading or webcrawling of any property or other data for inclusion in another real estate search site, content aggregator, or any other purpose is strictly forbidden without prior written consent from Redfin.

----Note: We won't be able to scrape Redfin data due to the above statement from Redfin. Below is a document about thinking how to collecting data in a web scrape way. It won't be implemented!! Anyone who wants to implement it is at his/her own obligation.

Crawl Redfin listing information.

Types: New Listing, Sold. For New Listing, we can always crawl it. For Sold and initial setup, we crawl all at once. For Sold and Update, we crawl recent sold.

Starting URL Feed: We define a function start_url_load() to load starting URLs. 

Example: 

Crawling Sold all for Cupertino CA

allowed_domain: www.redfin.com

Starting URL: https://www.redfin.com/city/4561/CA/Cupertino/filter/include=sold-all

Rules: <a class="selected goToPage" or <a class="clickable goToPage", follow=TRUE. We iterate all pages by simulating clicking Next.

Selected goToPage Sample:

<a class="selected goToPage" data-reactid=".1szsvqm3lz4.1.1:$table.3.1:$page0" data-rf-test-id="react-data-paginate-page-0" href="/city/4561/CA/Cupertino">1</a>

Clickable goToPage:

<a class="clickable goToPage" data-reactid=".1szsvqm3lz4.1.1:$table.3.1:$page1" data-rf-test-id="react-data-paginate-page-1" href="/city/4561/CA/Cupertino">2</a>

When iterating all pages, we only retrieve URLs of each property. In this part, we don't retrieve any property information, because as in Zillow, retrieving property information is duplicate and is impacted by page layouts. 

Sample:

<div class="address" data-reactid=".1szsvqm3lz4.1.1:$table.1.0.1.$TableRow_1.$TableRowColumn_1.$address773092">
	<a data-reactid=".1szsvqm3lz4.1.1:$table.1.0.1.$TableRow_1.$TableRowColumn_1.$address773092.$address773092" title="20800 Valley Green Dr, Cupertino, CA" href="/CA/Cupertino/20800-Valley-Green-Dr-95014/home/773092">20800 Valley Green Dr</a>
</div>

We can get //a[@data-reactid] and send HTTP requests to retrieve individual property information.

In the parsing callback, we parse property information page for the following information:
